This project builds a personalized financial advisor system using a Stacking Regressor ensemble model (combining GradientBoostingRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, XGBRegressor, and LinearRegression) to predict spending habits, identify overspending, and suggest practical savings across expense categories. It also accurately estimates tax liability based on the FY 2025–26 new Indian tax regime, which exempts income up to ₹12 lakh and applies progressive tax rates beyond that. The goal is to provide a clear, data-driven financial overview to help users budget smarter, save more, and plan better.
